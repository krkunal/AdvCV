## Gradient and Color spaces

The IPython notebooks in this repository contain code to - 
 
1. Using Histogram peraks to identify lane lines
2. Using sliding window + polynomial fit approach to find lane lines
3. Using previous frame's lane line polynomials to determine lane limes in the next frame
4. Determining the radius of curvature in pixel & physical spaces
